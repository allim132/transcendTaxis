This is a class assignment for group 7. Its members are Alex Nguyen, Ashley Qian, Steffanie Mock, and Gurpreet Banwait.

The following is a introduction and project overview drafted in our System Requirements Analysis document:

```
Our team has been tasked to develop a taxi driving game. As a driver, your goal is to pick
up passengers and bring them to their destination. You will also have to contend against the
greatest enemy of all drivers: pedestrians and other drivers. You will have to do your best to
avoid these obstacles to bring your passengers to their destination. The obstacles donâ€™t just
include other people. In one moment, you may be struggling to avoid sliding in icy conditions,
and in the next, you could have to avoid flying debris from a volcano. Both environmental
conditions and disasters will affect the difficulty in your task as a taxi driver. You will be
competing against time in delivering your passengers and achieving the highest score. Your goal
is to transport the passengers in a timely manner while also doing their best to satisfy the
various temperaments. After time is up, if your score is high enough, then you win.
